# Basic-image-classifier-PyTorch

## Main objective

Complete implementation of a basic image classifier using PyTorch.

## Context

This assignment is developed in Python 3 for the Advanced Topics in Machine Learning course of the Master in Computer Science in the university of Bern, Switzerland.

The train and test data were given. The objective was to implement a linear classification model and its training with PyTorch's optimizer and loss function. Some kind of problem should then appear, be understood and fixed.

This assignment was an individual work and took approximatively 6 hours as it was my first time using PyTorch.

Spring 2020.
